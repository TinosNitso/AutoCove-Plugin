# AutoCove-Plugin

![alt text](https://github.com/TinosNitso/AutoCove-Plugin/blob/main/v1.0.5.WebP)

Unfortunately v1.0.5 doesn't retain highlighting properly when switching spells (like in above WebP). Next version will remember the highlighted text properly! There will be an asm & hex combo-box (instant stripping of leading blue bytes etc, works with all PUSHDATAs, 1Nâ†’OP_1N). Asm should help with CashScript compatibility, because its "bytecode" is in asm by default (currently can use `cashc --hex` for AutoCove compatibility). The next *preturn*... covenant will support P2SH (min 3 data-pushes, max 2of2 compressed & 252B sigscript, compatible with VanityTXID) returns as well as P2PKH (all correspond to 2 data-pushes). There will be an OpCount with the Byte Count. TXID lookup. Hex input can start with '0x' etc. And there'll be a new tabIcon based on a Wikimedia flag icon. Also, colors will all work in the dark color theme.

There's a bug sometimes when two or more wallets are open. The decoder loads from the other wallet's memory somehow! (Will be fixed in next update.)

Fully automatic covenants forward payments without any further authorization. Parental introspection can be achieved using PrivKey=1, so that PubKey is the compressed base point of secp256k1.

I worked full-time for years at a factory named after Cathedral **Cove**, in NZ. *Cove* is also short for *Covenant*! So *AutoCove* seemed like a nice name. Its current covenant address & script is:

**v1.0.4** [preturn49xt9r8n82rr0lwmzxpgxf6hv4v3gya4qk9](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/preturn49xt9r8n82rr0lwmzxpgxf6hv4v3gya4qk9) ([AutoCove_pReturn#157609; ðŸŒµ](https://www.cashaccount.info/#lookup) Cash Account):
>6fad7b828c7f757ca87bbb7d547f7701207f01207f7701247f757daa8801207f7578aa8878820134947f77587f7581788277940239029458807c012a7f77517f7c7f77517f7c7f75a9041976a9147c7e7e0288ac7eaa7c820128947f7701207f7587080500000001e5413e75

In the case of *preturn*..., it will return whatever coins are sent to it, automatically, assuming some conditions:
- Sender must use a **P2PKH** address (starting with *q* or *1*, but not P2PK).
- Sending transaction must be no more than **520B**. Only 3 inputs at most.
- 14 bits minimum for only 1 input. **More** bits needed per extra input.
- 21 BCH max (theoretically), but I've only ever [tested](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/c3350c09687b922c4d91d9a504b11ea9fac64e599b94975cc50d743f422eb7c4) just over a BCH (& 10 tBCH on a [testnet4](https://testnet4.imaginary.cash/tx/c2dbbccf399c0a4f7bfa847b95feb44d2fb56254d4a820b28325b443b6874c87)). I've tested multiple inputs & outputs, both Schnorr & ECDSA, & both compressed & uncompressed PubKeys.
- 8â†’12 bits fee.
- Total amount will be returned to **first** input.
- Never send **SLP** tokens, or they'll be burned.
- Sender's sigscript must not be **malleated** in any way (eg by miner). The output pkscript should have no PUSHDATA OpCodes.

Another example could be address *ppythag0ras*... which only returns three coins at a time, and only if the same address sends them, and aÂ²+bÂ²=cÂ² (using OP_DIV we could check a/(c+b)=(c-b)/a). I don't like Spedn & CashScript (*spedn.exe* alone is 21MB).

Vanity hashes & addresses are generated using the [VanityTXID-Plugin](https://github.com/TinosNitso/VanityTXID-Plugin).

v1.0.5 notes:
- **All** OpCodes now supported. Correct decoding & blue coloring for PUSHDATA2 & PUSHDATA4. REVERSEBYTES included as Crypto (Qt.magenta). It had its own CHIP & I've never seen it used, so I missed it in v1.0.4. Next version might use darkBlue for byte/s following a PUSHDATA, instead of blue.
- codes (Pythonic-style) & **op_codes** now selectable, as well as CODES, OP_CODES etc.
- Highlight color now set to reduce Selection HSL darkness(=255-L) by **25%**. Unfortunately 25% mightn't be enough on macOS, due to the pale blue.
- Bugfix for EC-v3.6.6. Unfortunately v1.0.4 broke backwards compatibility without me realizing, due to instant combo-box activation. **SLP Ed.** now supported.
- Bugfix for auto-decode, when unable to.
- SHA256 checksum 00000000b514a883d6f742eb82c0585a695c021fc8ca7f99e9d8f713e3c1fadb (44 kH/s Â· 10 mins). **Luckiest** hash yet! Updating via reinstall requires restarting EC.

v1.0.4 notes:
- OP_CODES, CODES, Codes & Op_Codes combo-box, with **highlighted** activation!
- Auto-decodes now **saved** into a combo-box, with 'Clear all...' item.
- Bugfix for when sender's txn is **exactly** size 255B.
- Highlighting is now a slightly **different** color. Unfortunately the macOS shade I chose is too light - will be fixed next time.
- OpCodes list display improved, with purple for Native Introspection. darkCyan was a tiny bit too close to darkGreen, so Locktime can be darkYellow & Reserved words brown (dark orange). Lines broken up into nullary, unary, binary & ternary etc.
- '//' comments are now fully enabled.
- Bugfix for auto-decode when user holds in delete.
- Users can now copy-paste whole raw txns and the decoder will store all P2SH Scripts. Another decoder is at [imaginary.cash](https://testnet4.imaginary.cash/decoder).
- BOOLAND now **ends** lines (auto-decode).
- Decoding in-Script data pushes up to **255B** size now supported (instead of just 0x4b).
- Thread.isAlive renamed to Thread.is_alive, to resolve [Issue #1](https://github.com/TinosNitso/AutoCove-Plugin/issues/1). I still haven't built EC itself from source, though. Apparently builds are **deterministic**. 
- Description moved from its own box to Script comments. Improved TabIcon.
- preturn Script which is only 108B. Malleability was [fixed](https://read.cash/@BigBlockIfTrue/achievement-unlocked-bitcoin-cash-fixed-all-common-third-party-transaction-malleation-vectors-219682ef) years ago.
- SHA256 Checksum 0000001e9dba81c3416e191153644daed60081aacf24f226055db613f0abb4f7 (49 kH/s Â· 1min).

v1.0.3 notes:
- Hex **decoder**! Copy paste any script hex into the Script box, and it will be auto-decoded into readable form. This lets us color in any BCH Script (& hex), eg from Mecenas or Hodl plugins, using only their blockchain hex. The exact decoding rules seem subjective: 16 words/line max; data pushes >=20B get their own lines; any VERIFY, NUM2BIN or BIN2NUM ends lines; tabbing for IF, NOTIF, ELSE etc. 
- *preturn* covenant now has malleability fix which blocks miners from **stealing** the money. Both compressed & uncompressed sender PubKeys have been tested, as well as Schnorr & ECDSA sigs.
- 6 **disabled** OpCodes are now listed.
- More efficient coloring by only coloring when either hex (bytecode) or selection has changed.
- **Split**-word selection highlighting. e.g. Selecting 'R OR' highlights all instances of 'OR' in hex.
- 'New' QComboBox item, but still no memory (nor undo & save).
- Increased return broadcast **delay** to 2s.
- SHA256 Checksum 000000ed60808ac146dd2cba2c19bbcdd96c968b5be1972a440fe7c33b73494e (51 kH/s Â· 44 s). Restart EC if updating via re-install.

v1.0.2 notes:
- *preturn...* covenant has **7%** fee reduction by eliminating unnecessary PubKey & *BIN2NUM*. Improved comments.
- Full list of colored **OpCodes**.
- Selecting text now **highlights** all instances of it. Works with both colors & B&W. Highlighting is maintained when toggling colors. 
- Highlighting works with scriptCode **hex**, too, as a byte search. i.e. double-click OpCodes or data push to light up all instances of its hex. Should also work with testnet OpCodes which I haven't colored. If script can't be interpreted, then there's no hex highlighting. Isolate multiple lines of code in hex by selecting them.
- *Colors* option. The blue isn't accurate for PUSHDATA2 & PUSHDATA4. Adding serifs to default font is too difficult (BCH code differentiation). The assignment of colors can change in the future. Holding in space-bar with colors will max out a CPU processor.
- **Hex** coloring, too! This increases CPU lag, which was barely noticeable for script-only colors.
- Added **malleability** warning, along with P2PK & SLP warnings. Sender should use standard output (no OP_PUSHDATA), or else EC doesn't detect it.
- Bug-fix for when a new wallet imports a *preturn...* and plugin tries to re-broadcast before wallet has had time to fully analyze history.
- **TabStopDistance** reduced to 4 chars.
- SHA256 Checksum **000000**eab8901f17435840ff2a80367d035966f436219425741ec473625b71da (60 kH/s Â· 10s).

v1.0.1:
- Script compiler (encoder) now included. Accepts both lower & upper case opcodes. Both 'Nip' & 'OP_NIP' encode the same. Byte counter included, along with BCH address gen. A future version needs to color the different opcodes in different colors. Maybe a save feature, and decoder? The "IDE" builds the BCH address as user types opcodes etc.
- Covenants' source-code now inside plugin tab. Both are enforced simultaneously.
- Extra line of assembly -> **5%** fee increase, but guarantees return TX has only 1 input.
- No more infinite loop, instead **.history_updated_signal** is used.
- Will return multiple UTXOs in the same sent UTX (bugfix).
- New **tabIcon**, but it could be improved (wavy BCH flag?).
- EC needs to be restarted when updating using re-install. There's an issue where importing a *preturn*... address causes attempted re-broadcasting of previous txns. I forgot to mention a couple rules in the plugin tab: sender must use P2PKH address, & return is always to 1st input.
- SHA256 Checksum **000000**db889e8d14c3b992cd6f1ef75cce65d44641d9487eb066cddac46ea82d (79 kH/s Â· 48 s)
