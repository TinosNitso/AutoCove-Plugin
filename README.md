Plugin can decode CashScript hex, like for smartBCH SHA-Gate [cc_covenant_v1.cash](https://github.com/smartbch/shagate/blob/main/cc_covenant_v1.cash) (without native introspection):
`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`

Alternatively, copy paste redeem Scripts from other networks, like from [this](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/tx/4f8d776c85b1fc15c1125e7043a9aee70e33f0793b472823e3946a8de075bec4) BTC-testnet **L**ight**N**ing `to_local` txn:
`6321026644cb387614f66421d14da3596c21cffa239011416c9adf3f351ee8551a9fc767029000b27521029654f80732769d7c435a184a3559f12178315526c53bbf003349390811c7590a68ac`

If there's ever a discrepancy between 2 large Scripts, a neat trick is to turn off the colors (for speed), maximize EC, & then use the address combo-box to instantly switch btwn them. To verify the difference, edit one Script until the address matches the other. Another trick is to scroll through the (3of5) 20 inputs example, to see how ECDSA multisigs vary.

Another example is from [slp_dollar.artifact](https://github.com/simpleledger/Electron-Cash-SLP/blob/cashscript-dev/lib/cashscript/slp_dollar.artifact). It's for SLP tokens which can always be frozen by the issuer, by forcibly sending any possible descendent to a frozen state. There's a bug since DEPTH+Î”>1 for all branches.

Fully automatic covenants forward payments without any further authorization. Parental introspection can be achieved using PrivKey=1, so that PubKey is the compressed base point of secp256k1.

I worked full-time for years at a factory named after Cathedral **Cove**, in NZ. *Cove* is also short for *Covenant*! So *AutoCove* seemed like a nice name. Its current covenant address & script is:

**v1.1.0** [preturn64ylcxyx9fktkrf8jpdanp4qvjyuqmfa2xe](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/preturn64ylcxyx9fktkrf8jpdanp4qvjyuqmfa2xe) (pReturn#161132; ðŸ§€ [Cash Account](https://www.cashaccount.info/#lookup)):
>78547f7701207f01207f7701247f757daa8801207f7578aa8878820134947f77587f7581788277940202029458807c01297f77517f7c01007e817f75517f7c817f77517f7c817f826377517f7c817f826377517f7c7f6875a90317a9147c7e7e01876775a9041976a9147c7e7e0288ac687eaa78820128947f7701207f7588a85279828c7f757c5279abbbac0801000000009ab19a75

In the case of *preturn*..., it will return whatever coins are sent to it, automatically, assuming some conditions:
- Sender must use a **P2PKH** or **P2SH** address (but not P2PK).
- P2SH sender must use 3 or 4 data pushes, â‰¤75B each, in their unlocking sigscript â‰¤252B. Compressed 1of1, 1of2, 2of2 & VanityTXID are all compatible. However non-0 constant pushes like OP_N aren't supported.
- Sending transaction must be no more than **520B**. Only 3 inputs at most.
- 13 bits minimum for only 1 input. ~2 bits **more** needed per extra input.
- 21 BCH max (theoretically), but I've only tested up to 10tBCH. I've tested 1of1, 2of2, multiple inputs & outputs, Schnorr & ECDSA, both compressed & uncompressed PubKeys (P2PKH) on [testnet4](https://testnet4.imaginary.cash/address/bchtest:preturn5pf0m9dnrjwqx0ttca4f8pxfvschu2rd4cd).
- 7â†’10 bits fee.
- Total amount will be returned to **first** (0th) input.
- Never send **SLP** tokens.
- Sender's sigscript must not be **malleated** in any way (eg by miner). The output pkscript should have no PUSHDATA OpCodes.

Another example could be address *ppythag0ras*... which only returns three coins at a time, and only if the same address sends them, and aÂ²+bÂ²=cÂ² (using OP_DIV we could check a/(c+b)=(c-b)/a).

Vanity hashes & addresses are generated using the [VanityTXID-Plugin](https://github.com/TinosNitso/VanityTXID-Plugin).

v1.1.0 notes:
- `<dec>` input. e.g. can copy paste from [this](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops) CHIP.
- `<dec>` convert any Script using the `(hex, asm, <dec>)` combo-box. Can ID special <#>s.
- Drag & drop for .txn & CashScript .artifact files. I didn't bother with an 'Open' file button, and it's only 1 file at a time, and .artifact not working on Linux.
- New pReturn... Script reduces its fee by 18% using a CODESEPARATOR.
- No more exact Script duplicates in the combo-box.
- *1 line* button to condense any Script (with LineWrap). With asm, it's identical to CashScript artifact bytecode.
- CashAddr toggle connected.
- Font combo-box (Default vs Consolas PointSize(11)). Unfortunately Consolas isn't working on macOS.
- Lighter (blander) colors on black, aiming for equivalent clarity between B&W backgrounds (from a distance). Unfortunately not even gray is as clear on a black background!
- Bugfix for when choosing asm switches to 'New'. So now it's quick to scroll through sigscripts, in asm or `<dec>` form.
- Bugfix for when word '00' vanishes when converting to asm. More generally a '77' converts to 'NIP' instead of vanishing.
- SHA256 Checksum 000000d05ad1b70931563be4030fa3a9d6755787b081e8afee3e80df200a7f44 (25 kH/s Â· 31 mins). Updating via re-install requires restarting EC.

v1.0.9 notes:
- Bugfix for multi-word single-line whose leading word is hex, like *00 NIP* (v1.0.8 ignored everything after the *00*).
- URL input works the same as the TXID it contains. Will P2SH decode the 1st TXID which appears in .split('/').
- B&W toggle (check-box). One wallet can have black background, & another white.
- Appended size of each sigscript data push. Can discern Schnorr (<70B) from ECDSA (usually â‰¥70B) sigs, & check if push is getting close to 520B limit.
- Instant switching btwn Scripts in combo-box whenever they're from decoder memory. e.g. can quickly scroll through 121 2of3 inputs in [this](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/1fcd75baedf6cc609e6d0c66059fc3937a1d185fb50a15d812d0747544353e5d) 89 kBCH txn.
- Example TXIDs & Scripts shown by default.
- Adjusted purple on black to be a tiny bit brighter (in red). So it's like a mix between purple and magenta (adjusting colors reduces their purity). I've also mixed orange with yellow. On black: brown mixes with olive & sky-blue with cyan.
- Combo-box instant highlight-activation for EC-v3.6.6 (SLP Ed.).
- SHA256 Checksum 0000000a30508dceb6f214074e7cce209bac670ca5d29c139dfc35202d468ce6 (31 kH/s Â· 8 mins). Update via re-install requires restarting EC.

v1.0.8 notes:
- Bugfix for op counts: no longer count values â‰¤0x60. None of the Scripts I've seen exceed 201 ops, after all!
- Î” decoding. I've labelled the change in stack depth of each line Î”, except when there's an IFDUP or CHECKMULTISIG. Auto-comments still unaligned.
- Empty sigscript data-push now shown as OP_0 to be consistent with Blockchain.com, & may be less confusing.
- Font won't accidentally change anymore, due to copy-pasting TXIDs etc.
- Space & tab allowed after TXID, TX or Script. v1.0.7 didn't allow a space-bar after the TXID. PUSHDATAs now go on the same line as their data, to simplify Î”.
- Dark theme color changes: stronger blue for constants, darkMagenta a bit lighter. Still no B&W toggle.
- Instant switching between Scripts which have the same name in the combo-box. e.g. can scroll through multi-sigs in [this](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/fccebdc8fcf556bebeb91ded0339756e568b254a6aa797f22a74ec3787f8a5d0) TX.
- "#No P2SH input..." message for when TXID or TX has no such input.
- SHA256 Checksum 000000d74f7b1353ede9c99828411ca3a137489c022cf7f41d299e8b5627cadd (34 kH/s Â· 4 mins).

v1.0.7 notes:
- Bugfix for when asm+OP_CODES setting converts 011N into OP_1N (oops).
- Bugfix for auto-decode of TX with a sigscript containing an OP_N (instead of data) push. Improved auto-comment.
- Op & B counts for every line of auto-decode! This helps check a big Script like Mecenas never goes over the 201 ops limit. A future version should also count changes in stack depth, but this update is primarily bugfixes & correction to v1.0.6.
- darkMagenta & brown switched around.
- In dark theme, lighter light blue for constants. Also, quarter-gray background switched with black.
- TXID & other hex input is now allowed to have a tab after it (& '\n' too). Double-clicking a TXID in notepad selects the tab after it.
- macOS highlighting slightly lighter this time (an eighth difference, but still a quarter difference on Windows). Dark theme isn't available for Catalina, so I've never tested that on macOS. I'm starting to prefer the dark theme, but EC itself needs an update since it's got some blue text on black background, & some white on bright green, which is nearly unreadable.
- SHA256 Checksum: 000000928f656c2436c9d18f0f193f3944e9c90b7bb78813cf1591c91e5c06d4 (35 kH/s Â· 2 mins).

v1.0.6 notes:
- **asm** stripping (instant via combo-box). It works with PUSHDATA OpCodes, and highlighting. OpCodes 10-16 are given a leading 'OP_'. It's some tricky code! e.g. [Here](https://github.com/mr-zwets/RefreshContract/blob/main/refresh.json) is the RefreshTimer.cash CashScript bytecode.
- **OpCount** next to ByteCount. e.g. [Mecenas](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/4b84bd37e0660203da70796e9dd76f58f37d843917694c59ede7758ded5bb05f) has 228 ops, but only <201 ever execute.
- New v1.0.6 covenant supports both P2PKH & **P2SH** (3 or 4 data pushes â‰¤75B, â‰¤252B sigscript) returns. This enables VanityTXID address compatibility, so that sending TXID may be vanitized (but a miner malleating a data-push past 75B is a vulnerability).
- *0x* & *0X* hex input now accepted, but only for decoder, raw TX & TXID.
- Decoding whole txns now includes the whole **scriptSig** of each input with data-pushes as comments (1/line). Sort of like Blockchain.com. Unfortunately the SLP Ed. causes a bug when OP_0 is a data-push (as is common with multisig Scripts), but next update should fix it.
- **TXID** lookup if user pastes it instead of the txn. A neat trick is to line up lots of TXID examples and have the EC network fetch each successful stack.
- Byte/s following a *PUSHDATA* are now gray-blue, instead of blue.
- PUSHDATA4 added to *Disabled* list. BCH disabled it as part of a malleability fix, I think.
- Selection & highlighting maintained as spells are changed between CODES & OP_CODES etc. Tracking is ok, but for multiple words the selection doesn't change size.
- **Dark theme** fully supported! Keeping colors consistent is tricky. A future version could enable live toggling between white & dark. On MX Linux the combo-boxes are strange, but still work, in the dark theme.
- macOS highlighting now darker, but it turned out too dark!
- Bugfix so that multiple wallets each have their own auto-decoder memory (combo-box).
- 21 bytes/line max target for auto-decoder, instead of 16 words/line. e.g. HASH160 requires (1+20)B. BIN2NUM no longer ends lines. Oh & indents are 8 spaces.
- New tabIcon based on a public-domain WikiMedia flag icon. Still not animated.
- SHA256 Checksum: 000000b45c129df3950971cf14608568ac8cf8bf853e4b09dde0900dda1aca72 (36 kH/s Â· 12 mins).

v1.0.5 notes:
- **All** OpCodes now supported. Correct decoding & blue coloring for PUSHDATA2 & PUSHDATA4. REVERSEBYTES included as Crypto (Qt.magenta). It had its own CHIP & I've never seen it used, so I missed it in v1.0.4. Next version might use darkBlue for byte/s following a PUSHDATA, instead of blue.
- codes (Pythonic-style) & **op_codes** now selectable, as well as CODES, OP_CODES etc.
- Highlight color now set to reduce Selection HSL darkness(=255-L) by **25%**. Unfortunately 25% mightn't be enough on macOS, due to the pale blue.
- Bugfix for EC-v3.6.6. Unfortunately v1.0.4 broke backwards compatibility without me realizing, due to instant combo-box activation. **SLP Ed.** now supported.
- Bugfix for auto-decode, when unable to.
- SHA256 checksum 00000000b514a883d6f742eb82c0585a695c021fc8ca7f99e9d8f713e3c1fadb (44 kH/s Â· 10 mins). **Luckiest** hash yet!

v1.0.4 notes:
- OP_CODES, CODES, Codes & Op_Codes combo-box, with **highlighted** activation!
- Auto-decodes now **saved** into a combo-box, with 'Clear all...' item.
- Bugfix for when sender's txn is **exactly** size 255B.
- Highlighting is now a slightly **different** color. Unfortunately the macOS shade I chose is too light - will be fixed next time.
- OpCodes list display improved, with purple for Native Introspection. darkCyan was a tiny bit too close to darkGreen, so Locktime can be darkYellow & Reserved words brown (dark orange). Lines broken up into nullary, unary, binary & ternary etc.
- '//' comments are now fully enabled.
- Bugfix for auto-decode when user holds in delete.
- Users can now copy-paste whole raw txns and the decoder will store all P2SH Scripts. Another decoder is at [imaginary.cash](https://testnet4.imaginary.cash/decoder).
- BOOLAND now **ends** lines (auto-decode).
- Decoding in-Script data pushes up to **255B** size now supported (instead of just 0x4b).
- Thread.isAlive renamed to Thread.is_alive, to resolve [Issue #1](https://github.com/TinosNitso/AutoCove-Plugin/issues/1). I still haven't built EC itself from source, though. Apparently builds are **deterministic**. 
- Description moved from its own box to Script comments. Improved TabIcon.
- preturn Script which is only 108B. Malleability was [fixed](https://read.cash/@BigBlockIfTrue/achievement-unlocked-bitcoin-cash-fixed-all-common-third-party-transaction-malleation-vectors-219682ef) years ago.
- SHA256 Checksum 0000001e9dba81c3416e191153644daed60081aacf24f226055db613f0abb4f7 (49 kH/s Â· 1min).

v1.0.3 notes:
- Hex **decoder**! Copy paste any script hex into the Script box, and it will be auto-decoded into readable form. This lets us color in any BCH Script (& hex), eg from Mecenas or Hodl plugins, using only their blockchain hex. The exact decoding rules seem subjective: 16 words/line max; data pushes >=20B get their own lines; any VERIFY, NUM2BIN or BIN2NUM ends lines; tabbing for IF, NOTIF, ELSE etc. 
- *preturn* covenant now has malleability fix which blocks miners from **stealing** the money. Both compressed & uncompressed sender PubKeys have been tested, as well as Schnorr & ECDSA sigs.
- 6 **disabled** OpCodes are now listed.
- More efficient coloring by only coloring when either hex (bytecode) or selection has changed.
- **Split**-word selection highlighting. e.g. Selecting 'R OR' highlights all instances of 'OR' in hex.
- 'New' QComboBox item, but still no memory (nor undo & save).
- Increased return broadcast **delay** to 2s.
- SHA256 Checksum 000000ed60808ac146dd2cba2c19bbcdd96c968b5be1972a440fe7c33b73494e (51 kH/s Â· 44 s). Restart EC if updating via re-install.

v1.0.2 notes:
- *preturn...* covenant has **7%** fee reduction by eliminating unnecessary PubKey & *BIN2NUM*. Improved comments.
- Full list of colored **OpCodes**.
- Selecting text now **highlights** all instances of it. Works with both colors & B&W. Highlighting is maintained when toggling colors. 
- Highlighting works with scriptCode **hex**, too, as a byte search. i.e. double-click OpCodes or data push to light up all instances of its hex. Should also work with testnet OpCodes which I haven't colored. If script can't be interpreted, then there's no hex highlighting. Isolate multiple lines of code in hex by selecting them.
- *Colors* option. The blue isn't accurate for PUSHDATA2 & PUSHDATA4. Adding serifs to default font is too difficult (BCH code differentiation). The assignment of colors can change in the future. Holding in space-bar with colors will max out a CPU processor.
- **Hex** coloring, too! This increases CPU lag, which was barely noticeable for script-only colors.
- Added **malleability** warning, along with P2PK & SLP warnings. Sender should use standard output (no OP_PUSHDATA), or else EC doesn't detect it.
- Bug-fix for when a new wallet imports a *preturn...* and plugin tries to re-broadcast before wallet has had time to fully analyze history.
- **TabStopDistance** reduced to 4 chars.
- SHA256 Checksum **000000**eab8901f17435840ff2a80367d035966f436219425741ec473625b71da (60 kH/s Â· 10s).

v1.0.1:
- Script compiler (encoder) now included. Accepts both lower & upper case opcodes. Both 'Nip' & 'OP_NIP' encode the same. Byte counter included, along with BCH address gen. A future version needs to color the different opcodes in different colors. Maybe a save feature, and decoder? The "IDE" builds the BCH address as user types opcodes etc.
- Covenants' source-code now inside plugin tab. Both are enforced simultaneously.
- Extra line of assembly -> **5%** fee increase, but guarantees return TX has only 1 input.
- No more infinite loop, instead **.history_updated_signal** is used.
- Will return multiple UTXOs in the same sent UTX (bugfix).
- New **tabIcon**, but it could be improved (wavy BCH flag?).
- EC needs to be restarted when updating using re-install. There's an issue where importing a *preturn*... address causes attempted re-broadcasting of previous txns. I forgot to mention a couple rules in the plugin tab: sender must use P2PKH address, & return is always to 1st input.
- SHA256 Checksum **000000**db889e8d14c3b992cd6f1ef75cce65d44641d9487eb066cddac46ea82d (79 kH/s Â· 48 s)
